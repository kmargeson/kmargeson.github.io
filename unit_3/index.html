    <p>I tweet, pin, like, blog, post, check in, share, comment, and engage in internet adventures for a living- and for fun. I blend traditional and innovative marketing strategies to build brands and grow online presence. I am a native to this digital media world we live in. I take that intrinsic knowledge, combine it with my ability to adapt along with my unquenchable thirst to learn, add some experience, my innovative thinking and of course my creative touch to hatch me- a digital creative.</p>

	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>A Few Fun Facts</p>
	<p>I started my own business when I was 9 years old, I once owned a vehicle that needed bungee cords just to keep the doors closed, my bucket list is 89 items long- but one of my top desires is to see the Northern Lights, I have dual citzenship -- U.S. and British, I've won awards for public speaking, I am a sucker for terrible puns, I'm an avid hiker and traveler, lover of coffee and IPA's.</p>

	<h3>My two cents on digital marketing...</h3>
	<p>You often hear stories about people who knew exactly what they wanted to be when they were just a kid. Whether it was a nurse, fire fighter, actor, lawyer, police officer, or teacher- it's amazing how many people have actually become those childhood dreams. Not me. Perhaps you know of those who have taken over the family business or followed in their parents' career steps in life. Not me either.

	Now, this isn't because I don't have an innate passion for marketing that started as a child- it's because realistically my career path in digital marketing didn't even exist then. But between you and me? That's one of the things I love most about what I do.

	The internet as we know it began in the early 1990's. The web 1.0 only allowed users to passively take in information and didn't offer sharing capabilities, Google emerged, and the first 'cookie' was created to track data. Web 2.0 created a socially driven world. Somewhere in between all those firsts the need for digital marketing was born. And with it, my future.

	Digital marketing enables me to be innovative and creative. It demands that I have constant intellectual curiosity, the ability to be adaptable, a permanent thirst for knowledge (and staying up to date), and the desire to understand why things happen. You see, I love that digital marketing couldn't have been a childhood dream for me. Because that means I have found my passion in a field that is fresh and young, constantly changing, and holds a future with aspects that we as humans haven't even thought of yet.</p>
